## Credits

Thank you to [PrimeSonic](https://github.com/PrimeSonic), [MrPurple6411](https://github.com/MrPurple6411) and [tobeyStraitjacket](https://github.com/tobeyStraitjacket) for essentially holding my hand through the making of my first mod and whos mods I learned and drew most of my inspiration from.

Thank you to [Metious](https://github.com/Metious) for volunteering to be the guinea pig that tested my mod and pointing out all the bugs.

Thank you to [DaWrecka](https://github.com/dawrecka) and [MrPurple6411](https://github.com/MrPurple6411) reteaching me what I'm supposed to do, apparently 8 months away is all it takes to forget everything about subnautica modding when you normally live in C++ land.
